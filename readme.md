# 🌱 Krishi Dost – Smart Farming Assistant

Krishi Dost is a **smart agriculture application** designed to help farmers make **data-driven decisions** using **machine learning, image analysis, and real-time recommendations**. The application focuses on improving **crop productivity, soil health, and early disease detection** through a user-friendly mobile platform.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation
Farmers often rely on traditional knowledge and limited expert access, which can lead to:
- Incorrect crop selection
- Late detection of crop diseases
- Poor soil and fertilizer management

Krishi Dost aims to bridge this gap by providing **AI-powered insights** directly to farmers using a mobile application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assist farmers in selecting the right crops
- Detect crop diseases at early stages using images
- Analyze soil conditions and recommend fertilizers
- Provide an easy-to-use digital farming assistant

---

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. The user uploads a **crop or soil image** through the mobile app
2. The image is processed using **machine learning models**
3. Backend APIs analyze the input data
4. The system generates **predictions and recommendations**
5. Results are displayed in a simple and understandable format
